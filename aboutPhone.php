        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>A well-assembled construction with a metal rim will not succeed even with stronger bending in the hand. In
            addition, we also have water resistance with IP68 certification, which in translation means mastering a
            half-hour stay in fresh water with a maximum depth of one and a half meters. However, LG goes even further
            in resilience. The elegant design meets the standard of the MIL-STD 810G military certificate, consisting of
            several tests, among which we can find, for example, resistance to temperature extremes, sudden temperature
            changes, vibrations, humidity and the like.
            The LG V30 fits well in the hand and handling is safe. The smooth back wall does not slip on uneven
            surfaces, I can only blame it for its susceptibility to imprints and dirt. Despite the larger dimensions, I
            could comfortably reach the opposite part of the screen with my finger, without significant palpation in the
            hand.

        <h2>Sound</h2>
        <p>At first glance, the audio equipment is not too surprising. At the top we find an audio connector for
            connecting headphones, but in the bottom wall there is a loudspeaker, the quality of which I rate as
            average, perhaps slightly above average. I mainly missed the depths here. However, the sound quality is
            hidden inside. The LG V30 boasts a 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC (Digital-to-analog Converter) converter and the
            package also includes B&O Play headphones. Phone has equalizer with 5 presets: normal, enhanced, detailed,
            live, bass. Here are few ringtones:<audio controls>

        <h2>Screen</h2>
        The large six-inch screen offers a fine resolution of 1440 x 2880 pixels, on which images and videos look great.
        However, you will also find the function of reducing the resolution to medium (2160 x 1080 pixels) or low (1440
        x 720 pixels) in the settings. I've used the maximum resolution all along, but in situations where you want to
        save every percentage of the battery, this option will definitely work.

        <h2>Chipset</h2>
        <p>A powerful dose of power under the hood is provided by the powerful Snapdragon 835 from Qualcomm. The thin
            body playfully tames his passions, and even with more demanding use, you will not notice the increased
            temperature of the structure. Again, we did not miss the test in the AnTuT benchmark, in which the LG V30
            scored up to 158,376 points. So there is enough performance for the next year or two. The system has 4 GB of
            RAM running under the thumb. Responses are fast and smooth, you can also rely on running multiple
            applications at once, switching between them without reloading the content.</p>

        <h2>Cameras</h2>
        <p>
            : This is also confirmed by the improved aperture on the main camera, which jumped from f / 1.8 to excellent
            f / 1.6 compared to the LG V20 and G6 models, and was also pleasantly surprised by the improvement of the
            wide-angle camera, which improved from f / 2.4 to f / 1.9. During almost two years of use, I took hundreds
            of photos and I am very satisfied with the result.
            The LG V30 is sure to win video recording fans as well. LG Cine Video mode allows you to capture
            really interesting videos. Several filters are ready with the possibility of adjusting their intensity.
            During the
            recording, I also really liked the Zoom point zoom, which can smoothly zoom in on any object in the shot,
            whether it is in the center or on the edge. In addition to quality optics, the V30 also offers excellent
            audio conditions and the recorded sound is really high quality.

        <h2>Battery</h2>
        <p>We ride the wave of enthusiasm to the end, which traditionally belongs to the battery. And even here the LG
            V30 did not disappoint. The thin body hides a battery with a capacity of 3300 mAh, which will hold you even
            on the most demanding day. Overall, I rate the endurance as slightly above average, and I reached for the
            charger until the next day for lunch, which is decent. On a busy day, when the display was lit for almost
            six hours, I still had less than 15% before midnight.</p>
